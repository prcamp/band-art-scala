# band-art-scala
a processing project written in scala

I'm working in Intellij. For the project to compile you need to go to the module settings at the top level, and add the `processing.core` library to the project. A description of this step exists in several other processing in scala projects you can find on the web. Fork the first commit for a very minimal example of a working drawing.
